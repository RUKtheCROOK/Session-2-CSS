      <h3>Johns Bio:</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <b><i>John Anthony Garcia III</i></b
        >. I grew up in <mark>El Paso TX</mark> and moved around alot because my
        dad was in the military. From Texas I moved to
        <mark>Nebraska</mark> where I started highschool. In highschool I met
        the love of my life, <b><i>Megan Grace</i></b
        >, and shortly after joined the United States Air Force. In the Air
        Force I was a Space <ins>Systems Operator</ins> and a
        <ins>GPS Warfighter</ins>. My main specialty was
        <ins>Navigation Warfare</ins> and I took part in many excersizes and
        real world operations. I did this for upwards of 5<sup>ish</sup> years
        before separating from the service. After separating I decided that I
        wanted to work in the tech feild and decided that SDGKU was the right
        place for me to learn how to code. Currently I am trying to learn as
        much as I can to hopefully secure a job as a software engineer in
        <mark>Nebraska</mark> before moving on to somewhere with more adventure!
        <br /><br />
        Adventure= Somwhere with an ocean preferebly, possibly:<sub
          >Floridia, California, and maybe even overseas somewhere.</sub
